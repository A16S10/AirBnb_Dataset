# Description
Welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis of AirBnb_NYC_2019! This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. The goal of this project is to understand the factors that influence the price of Airbnb rentals in New York City.

The analysis includes feature engineering, data visualization, and business insights. Feature engineering involved cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to remove missing values and outliers. New features were created to capture the location, type of rental, and other factors that could affect the price. Data visualization was used to identify patterns and relationships in the data. Business insights were generated from the analysis, including the most popular neighborhoods, average price, and most popular type of rental.

This project can be helpful to anyone who is interested in starting an Airbnb rental in New York City. The insights generated from the analysis can be used to make informed decisions about pricing, location, and other factors.
